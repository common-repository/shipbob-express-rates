Dynamically provide an affordable two-day ground shipping option for customers who qualify for it.

== Description ==

Consumers want fast shipping. ShipBob Express plug-in allows merchants to  dynamically provide real time shipping rates to all customers. This plug-in allows you to push an estimated shipping rate to customers as they check out on your Woocommerce store in real time, so your customers can pay for the rate you are charged by ShipBob.

Shipbob also offers a 2-day ship option for faster delivery to your customers which can be set up in your Shipbob merchant dashboard or enabled via Shipbob merchant care. ShipBob Express plug-in helps in displaying rates for 2 day ship-option at check-out so that your customers can get faster deliveries based on zip-code eligibility.

*How does ShipBob's 2-Day Express work?*

ShipBob operates 40+ fulfillment centers to help you reach your customers across the United States more efficiently. Based on which fulfillment centers your inventory is in, you will be able to use our technology to add a 2 Day Shipping option to your check out for clients in zip codes where we know we can get to in 2 Days at lower rates. This lets sellers dynamically provide an affordable two-day ground shipping option for those who qualify while hiding it from customers who are outside of the guaranteed two-day coverage. This allows us to offer a 2 Day option that is cheaper than the regular 2 Day services.
